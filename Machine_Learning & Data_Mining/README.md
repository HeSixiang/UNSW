# Machine Learning & Data Mining 机器学习和数据挖掘 2020/T1 (COMP9417)
## Overview and Links 
This course explores machine learning as the algorithmic approach to learning from data. The course also covers key aspects of data mining, which is understood as the application of machine learning tools to obtain insight from data. Algorithms are placed in the context of their theoretical foundations in order to understand their derivation and correct application. Topics include: linear models for regression and classification, local methods (nearest neighbour), neural networks, tree learning, kernel machines, unsupervised learning, ensemble learning, computational and statistical learning theory, and Bayesian learning. To expand and extend the development of theory and algorithms presented in lectures, practical applications will be given in tutorials and programming tasks during the project.<br/>
